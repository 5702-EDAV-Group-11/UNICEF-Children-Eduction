The common goal is to let more and more children receive a high-quality education, even in developing countries. While achieving this goal, there is a specific group of people that we cannot ignore – children with functional difficulties. Compared with healthy children, children with functional difficulties have more disadvantages in the process of survival and development due to their physical and mental characteristics and lack of social support. Therefore, they are a vulnerable group that needs special care, special support, and special protection. Like all other children, children with functional difficulties share the right to life development and education. The level of education and rehabilitation of children with functional difficulties also reflects social civilization and progress. Accordingly, we must pay great attention to the education attainment worldwide for children with functional difficulties. We found a dataset from UNICEF, focusing on the education of the least developed and developing countries for children with and without functional difficulties. We hope to express a clear picture of the educational attainment worldwide for children with and without functional difficulties to our readers so that we can explore more about what we can do to help children with functional difficulties together. Since the data is labeled with development levels and divided into male, female, urban, and rural, we are going to compare the influences of development levels, genders, and regions on Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR) and Out-of-school children rate(OOSR) for all primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education levels, the Completion Rate for primary level, and the Functional Learning Skills(reading and numeracy). Since there are nine indicators in total, we are curious about the comprehensive performance. Specifically, all the indicators will contribute to assessing a country’s education level. Thus, instead of using predictive models to calculate the weight of each one, we use the mean value to analyze the overall performance for different development levels. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit approved 17 sustainable development goals (SDG). Proper and quality education for every child in this world is always one of the goals. However, children of least-developed countries and some developing countries are not guaranteed equal education. Let alone children with functional difficulties. Children with functional difficulties could experience various limitations, such as communication, self-care, and mobility difficulties. Creating an appropriate learning environment and suitable teaching strategies for children with disabilities is challenging, leading to a lower percentage of education for children with disabilities. Even worse, the pandemic during the last three years has severely influenced the world, including education. Nearly half of the in-person instruction was closed during the pandemic. Remote learning has become the only solution for all students across the globe. However, not every region and child has proper equipment and stable internet access. The data set from UNICEF focuses on the education of the least developed and developing countries for children with and without functional difficulties, aiming to understand the percentage of education completeness in different countries, education levels, and genders. The latest update was in December 2021. Although not every country’s data is updated, we still hope to find the influence of the pandemic. Citation: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals The 4\\(^{\\text{th}}\\) Goal (Quality Education) 2.2 Data availability We are interested in children’s education, and UNICEF was the first site we visited for data. There is one dataset provided on the site for children with disabilities. The completeness and availability are the top two reasons why we considered it to be suitable for our topic. UNICEF maintains the dataset. The UNICEF Global databases contain a set of 202 countries as reported on through the State of the World’s Children Statistical Annex 2017. And the format of data collected is excel. By the cover page of the dataset, the data was collected from the 6th round of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6). The dataset provides information on four education indicators (Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR), Out of school rate (OOR), Completion rate, and foundational learning skills) supporting national education monitoring for children with and without disabilities in 32 countries and areas. The dataset takes levels of education into account for two indicators: Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR) and Out of school rate (OOR). The Completion rate is recorded on the primary level only. Foundational learning skills consist of foundational reading and numeracy skills, recorded for children aged 7 to 14. The data is only available in Excel. There are ten sheets in the spreadsheet: nine data sheets and one cover page. The cover sheet provides a brief introduction and explanation of the data and variables. Three sheets are available for the Adjusted net attendance rate and the Out of school rate for three levels of education (primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary). The remaining three sheets are for Completion rate, foundational reading skill, and foundational numeracy skill. If any questions arise from the data, we can contact UNICEF Data. Since the data is available in Excel, we can directly load the “readxl” package in R and use the “read_excel” function to import the data. After importing the data, we will process the missing values and try to minimize the influence of time inconsistency. There are three potential issues relating to data quality. The data for different countries and areas are estimated values by point estimating, so there is a gap between the estimated value and real value. Also, the sample sizes for those countries and areas are unknown. The years in which the data collection took place differ for different countries and areas. Though not by a large percentage, there are some missing values. Citation: Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey - Education Analysis for Global Learning and Equity Contact Us: UNICEFDATA Database on education for children with disability "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our group checked many websites to decide which topic to focus on. Between education and healthy food, we chose children’s education as our topic and visited UNICEF’s authentical website for a confidential dataset. There are many datasets on that website, and the dataset of children’s education with or without disabilities interests us the most. It’s not only an interesting but meaningful topic. UNICEF maintains the dataset. The UNICEF Global databases contain a set of 202 countries as reported through the State of the World’s Children Statistical Annex 2017. However, in this dataset, only 32 countries are presented. The data is well-organized in an excel file. The data was collected from the 6th round of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6). There are ten sheets in this dataset that provide information on four education indicators (Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR), Out of school rate (OOR), Completion rate, and foundational learning skills) supporting national education monitoring for children with and without disabilities in 32 countries and areas. The dataset considers three levels of education for two indicators: ANAR Primary, ANAR Lower Secondary, ANAR Upper Secondary, OOSR Primary, OOSR Lower Secondary, and OOSR Upper Secondary. The Completion rate is recorded on the primary level only. Foundational learning skills consist of foundational reading and numeracy skills, recorded for children aged 7 to 14. Indicator Definition: 1. ANAR: Percentage of children of a given age that are attending an education level compatible with their age or attending a higher education level. 2. OOSR: Percentage of children or young people in the official age range for a given level of education who are not attending either pre-primary, primary, secondary, or higher levels of education. 3. Completion Rate: Percentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education (primary, lower secondary, or upper secondary) who have completed that level of education. Only the primary level is presented. 4. Foundational Learning Skills: Percentage of children achieving minimum proficiency in (i) reading and (ii) numeracy. If the child succeeds in 1) word recognition, 2) literal questions, and 3) inferential questions, s/he is considered to have foundational reading skills. If the child succeeds in 1) number reading, 2) number discrimination, 3) addition, and 4) pattern recognition, s/he is considered to have foundational numeracy skills. For all the 9 tables in the collected excel from UNICEF, the table headers are all the same. There are 18 variables in total, which are all characters. Since not all the variables are useful, we removed some columns during the data process, such as “Data source,” “Upper limit” and “Lower limit.” We also merged the 9 sheets into a big data frame with 1440 records. And all the point estimates’ units are the percentage. The dataset also has several practical issues. First, the method of how the data is collected can not promise precision. The data for different countries and areas are estimated by point estimating, so there is a gap between the estimated value and the real value. Second, the sample sizes for those countries and areas are unknown. Third, the years in which the data collection took place differ for different countries and areas, and the period format is also different. For example, some are “yyyy-yyyy”, such as “2017-2018,” while some are “yyyy”, such as “2017”. Fourth, there are many missing values for children with functional difficulties. Unfortunately, considering the values for different countries are limited and unrelated, it is difficult to impute by mean value or other methods. Due to these problems, we did further data cleaning based on this big data frame. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Integrate all sheets into one data frame: Use the “readxl” package to read the 9 tables separately. All nine tables have the same table header; hence, directly use “rbind” to integrate all the data frames into a whole data frame. Remove unnecessary columns: Remove seven columns that are unrelated to our project aim or might not be useful when drawing figures, such as “lower limit,” “upper limit,” and “data source.” Rename the columns: Rename the columns with simple and clear labels. Normalize the Time and Development: For the column “Time”, there are columns in the format like “yyyy-yyyy”; we use the beginning year for this time to replace it. For example, we use 2017 to replace “2017-2018”. For the column “Development,” we capitalize the first letter of all words. Change variable type: Convert the point estimate into numeric data type by “as.numeric.” Since we will use Time as a category, we are not going to convert the data type. Convert to tidy data: The point estimate for children with and without functional difficulties are presented in two columns. However, since they are one variable, we use pivot_longer to convert it into a tidy version. Deal with missing values: According to the analysis of missing values in 3.3, we decide to delete the rows with missing values in columns “total_point_estimate,” “with_point_estimate,” “without_point_estimate,” and “Development” 3.3 Missing value analysis We first look at the missing value for each column: ## Countries Indicator Category Time total_point_estimate Development ## 970 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## 372 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## 43 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## 15 1 1 1 1 1 0 ## 30 1 1 1 1 1 0 ## 10 1 1 1 1 0 1 ## 0 0 0 0 10 45 ## without_point_estimate with_point_estimate ## 970 1 1 0 ## 372 1 0 1 ## 43 0 0 2 ## 15 1 1 1 ## 30 1 0 2 ## 10 0 0 3 ## 53 455 563 The matrix returned with entry value missing = 0 and observed = 1 shows the total number of missing rows for each pattern. The last row represent the number of missing rows of each variable. We can see that the “without_point_estimate” and “with_point_estimate” has the most missing values, especially “with_point_estimate”, counts to 455, up to 65% of the whole missing values numbers (698). Then, we use the redav package to explore the missing pattern: From the top bar chart, we can see that missing values in variable “with_point_estimate” is much higher than other variables. For missing values, “with_point_estimate” and “without_point_estimate” rank second and third. From the two bottom graphs, it is easy to conclude that the most frequent missing pattern is only missing “with_point_estimate” variables. Considering “total_point_estimate”, “with_point_estimate”, “without_point_estimate”, and “Development” we deleted rows with missing values in these columns. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of Indicators’ Mean Point Estimate 4.2 Analysis of Individual Indicators’ Point Estimate 4.3 Relationship between Point Estimates", " Chapter 4 Results Our analysis is divided into three sections. First, we checked the overall performance by using the mean point estimate. By different combinations, we concluded that countries’ development levels had some effects on the overall educational attainment of children with and without functional difficulties. Also, females and urban areas had better comprehensive performances than males and rural regions. Children without functional difficulties perform better than children with functional difficulties. These conclusions all match our intuition. However, to ensure some extreme outliers do not influence the mean point estimates, we looked closely at each indicator with the actual data. In the second section, we first explored the influence of gender and region on attendance, out-of-school, and completion rates across the years. Although it’s hard to conclude genders’ impact, the gap in attendance, out-of-school, and completion rates between genders decreased over the years. For the region, we got the same conclusion - urban areas had better educational attainment. Then, we checked the attendance and out-of-school rates among the three education levels. The attendance rate is decreasing in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary. Thus, many children attended schools but failed to finish their secondary education. It follows that children had better reading skills than numeracy skills, which might be because numeracy skills need more practice in school, while the high out-of-school rate for secondary school prevented students’ learning. In the end, each indicator includes three groups of children: all the children, children with disabilities,and children without disabilities. We explored the relationship between these three variables. We concluded children with disabilities should be a small portion of the population since the total performance is almost the same value as the performance of children without disabilities. In contrast, children with disabilities generally have a lower scores. 4.1 Analysis of Indicators’ Mean Point Estimate The following analyses are based on the mean point estimate of ANAR(Primary, Lower Secondary, Upper Secondary), Completion Rate, and Foundational Learning Skills(Reading, Numeracy). OOSR indicator is calculated separately since it will negatively influence the mean point estimate. 4.1.1 Mean Point Estimate by Development Levels The figure below used the mean point estimate of ANAR(Primary, Lower Secondary, Upper Secondary), Completion Rate, and Foundational Learning Skills(Reading, Numeracy) because a higher value means better performance for all indicators. Surprisingly, less-developed countries had a lower mean in 2017 than least-developed countries. However, considering that data was only collected in 5 countries in 2017, it is possible that outliers decreased the mean of less developed countries. In 2018, the plot showed that countries with high development levels had higher mean indicators for children with and without disabilities. In 2019, there were no significant differences between less developed countries and more developed countries. More developed countries had a lower mean in the education level of children with and without disabilities. The least developed countries had a much lower mean than the rest. Over the years, the education level of children with and without disabilities decreased for least and more developed countries and increased for less developed countries. Education levels for children with and without disabilities increased similarly in less developed countries. The gap between the education levels of children with disabilities and without disabilities is the smallest in less developed countries and the largest in more developed countries. Figure 4.1: Mean Point Estimate by Development Levels 4.1.2 Indicators’ Mean Point Estimate Evaluations by Development Levels The Cleveland Dot Plot on the left contains mean point estimates across the years for six indicators. Of the six indicators, half of them are missing in more-developed countries. For other indicators, more-developed countries have higher means in ANAR Primary, Foundational Reading Skills, and Foundational Numeracy Skills for children with and without disabilities. Also, children without disabilities scored higher in attendance rate, completion rate, and foundational numeracy and reading skills than children with disabilities. We can also see in the graph that for all children, the attendance rate of lower secondary is 25% higher than that of upper secondary, and the attendance rate of primary education is about 45% higher than that of lower secondary. These drops in attendance rates were about the same for children with and without disabilities. The Cleveland Plot on the right is for out-of-school rates. The least developed countries had the highest upper-secondary out-of-school rate at around 30% and the highest out-of-school rates for primary and lower secondary. Least-developed countries had a higher out-of-school for primary than lower secondary, while less-developed countries had similar out-of-school for lower secondary and primary. More developed countries only had data on out-of-school rates for primary education, which is the lowest among the indicator means of three development levels. Also, children without disabilities had a lower out-of-school rate for all levels of education across all countries than children with disabilities. Figure 4.2: Indicator Evaluations by Development Levels 4.1.3 Mean Point Estimate by Development Levels, Gender, and Region The mean point estimate is calculated by taking the means of all indicators except out-of-school indicators collected from 2017 to 2019. No data was collected for females in more developed countries. Females performed better than males in all countries, with or without disabilities, which is similar to the conclusion drawn from the previous two Cleveland Dot Plots that female and male children without disabilities had better numeracy and reading skills and higher attendance rates than children with disabilities. Also, the more developed the country, the more significant the gap between the performance of children with and without disabilities. Urban areas generally had higher means than rural areas, especially for least developed countries. Unlike genders, development levels did not considerably influence regions — the more developed the country, the smaller the gap. Also, children with disabilities in rural areas are doing not as well as children without disabilities, but the difference is not as big as in urban areas. Figure 4.3: Difficulty Point Estimate by Development Levels, Gender, and Region 4.2 Analysis of Individual Indicators’ Point Estimate 4.2.1 Difficulty Point Estimate by Gender When considering the attendance rates or out-of-school rates of children especially in least and less developed countries, it is very natural to consider the influence of gender. From the group of bar charts shown below, there is no clear overall pattern. However, we can see that for primary and lower secondary education level, the ANAR gap between gender decreases as time goes. Thus, gender is not an influential factor for attendance rate and out-of-school rate individually. Figure 4.4: Difficulty Point Estimate by Gender 4.2.2 Difficulty Point Estimate by Region The following group of bar charts shows how region affects ANAR and OOSR. Children in urban areas had higher attendance than those in rural areas. The data from OOSR confirms this conclusion since children in rural areas had higher out-of-school rates than those in urban areas. Also, functional difficulties did not affect the considerable gap between urban and rural areas. Thus, region had a profound impact on a child’s educational attainment. Figure 4.5: Difficulty Point Estimate by Region 4.2.3 Completion Rate Primary Difficulty Point Estimate The completion rate is “Percentage of cohort of children or young people three to five years older than the intended age for the last grade of each level of education.” The left-hand-side bar chart presents whether gender affects children’s primary completion rate. Females have a higher completion rate than males, which is valid for children with and without functional disabilities. However, we can see that the gap between females and males decreased. The right-hand-side bar chart shows that children in urban areas have much higher completion rates than children in rural areas. Although children are three to five years older than the intended age of primary education, urban areas still have a higher completion rate. Thus, the urban and rural gap matches our common sense that urban areas have more educational resources and higher education coverage rates. Figure 4.6: Completion Rate Primary Point Estimate 4.2.4 Comparison between Education Levels The following two plots compared the total point estimate of ANAR and OOSR for all three education levels. The graph below shows the point estimate of ANAR for the three education levels: primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary. All three years shows that children at the primary education level tended to have higher attendance rate than the other higher levels. Figure 4.7: Comparison between Education Levels The graph below shows the point estimate of OOSR for the three education levels: primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary. All three years shows children in upper secondary education level tend to have higher out-of-school rate than the other higher levels. Figure 4.8: Comparison between Education Levels Combine the observations from the two Cleveland dot plots, we can conclude that children received the most basic education, but were prone to drop out of school before the age of 18. Thus, they still did not receive a complete K-12 education. 4.2.5 Functional Learning Skills Total Point Estimate This Cleveland dot plot shows the total point estimate of children’s foundational learning skills. The blue dot, represents reading skills, are almost always greater than the red one, which means numeracy skills. Thus, children with and without functional difficulties had higher reading skills than numeracy skills. It makes sense since word recognition, literal questions, and inferential question are frequently in contact in their daily life. Then recall that children have higher out-of-school rate in upper secondary school; so they did not have the opportunity to have more practice on numeracy skills, which usually require more time to success. Figure 4.9: Comparison between Education Levels 4.3 Relationship between Point Estimates We are going to use the following parallel coordinate charts to explore the relationship between total point estimate, point estimate with functional difficulties, and point estimate without functional difficulties. Figure 4.10: Relationship between ANAR Indicator’s Point Estimates For the three indicators of ANAR, the point estimate of total children and the point estimation of children without difficulties has a clear parallel relationship. Also, they have almost the same values. Although “with_point_estimate” has some differences from “without_point_estimate,” the overall trend is a parallel relationship. There is some unique information for the three indicators. a) ANAR Primary: there are two outliers, one in 2018 and the other in 2019. b) ANAR Lower Secondary: The variation of point estimate is more significant than the ANAR Primary indicator. c) ANAR Upper Secondary: Nearly half of the “with_point_estimate” is higher than “without_point_estimate” in 2019. Figure 4.11: Relationship between OOSR Indicator’s Point Estimates For the three indicators of OOSR, point estimate of total children and the point estimate of children without difficulties has parallel relationship. Specifically, a) OOSR Primary: variable with_point_estimate tend to have parallel relationship with variable without_point_estimate. Also, there are two outliers. b) OOSR Lower Secondary: most of the value in variable with_point_estimate have higher value than without_point_estimate in year 2018; but the overall relationship is still parallel. c)OOSR Upper Secondary: year 2018 and 2019’s without_point_estimate and with_point_estimate have similar value. However, for year 2017, without_point_estimate and with_point estimate have negative relationship. We can see that total point estimate and point estimate with functional difficulties are almost the same. Considering point estimate with functional difficulties fluctuated around the value of total point estimate, the number of children with functional difficulties should be a small portion of the survey’s total population so that its value did not influence the consistence between total point estimate and point estimate without functional difficulties. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takaways 6.2 Limitation 6.3 Future Directions and Lessons Learned", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takaways In general, among all countries, no matter how developed the country is, children with disabilities scored less than children without disabilities in terms of foundational reading and numeracy skills, which can be explained by the relatively low school attendance rate and primary education completion rate and the relatively high out-of-school rate. The gap between the average score for foundational skills of children with and without disabilities decreases as the country’s development level goes up. Over the years, the education level generally increases, and the increase rate is higher in more developed countries. The education level of all female and urban children also increases faster in more developed countries. However, looking at the highest percentage of children with disabilities completing primary education, we know a lot of work still needs to be done. Moreover, gender and region are two special categories. Gender is not an influential category, while region indicates that children in urban areas had higher attendance rates in all education levels and foundational learning skills than children in rural areas. 6.2 Limitation Although we have many conclusions from the ten groups of graphs, there are several limitations. First, as we mentioned, some missing values are hard to impute. We finally decided to remove those values. However, they might change some conclusions. The dataset consists of 32 countries for the least and less developed countries. However, UNICEF collected data from each country in different years. The inconsistency of Time increases the difficulty of analysis. Also, the variable Time is misleading; some are in the format “yyyy-yyyy” while others are “yyyy.” Without any explanation, we assume the first year mentioned in Time is the year the data collected. If we could accurately describe the time variable, the conclusion might be more precise regarding the changes over Time. This project aims to discover the influence of different categories on the nine indicators. Thus, we chose to use the point estimate. However, we did not use the upper and lower limits included in the data. Since the statistics we had are estimations, including the upper and lower bounds might provide more information. 6.3 Future Directions and Lessons Learned Considering the difficulties we encountered with the dataset, we could spend more time researching the dataset’s variables and make more confident decisions. Also, finding other sources for this topic might help us make decisions. We have analyzed education for children with and without disabilities in less developed countries, and exploring education in more developed countries can benefit the whole picture. In this project, we also have looked at how education levels differ by development levels, genders, and regions. Still, we have not considered how geography, religion, and other factors might contribute to the result. We can combine these factors in the future to see if more data and features can tell a different story. Drawing graphs can be easy but using the correct chart to produce an informative analysis and convert the visualization into a nontechnical description takes a lot of work. It is crucial to pick out the features that tell the most logical and wholesome story. Every set of features can make a plot convey some information, but some features will more efficiently display relationships. Eyeballing connections is one way of selecting features, but subsetting the data frame and making mini-plots might be more helpful. Last but not least, when presenting our results, having a clear logic for the order of graphs and the differences between sections is essential. Spending more time on the logic can make the report more readable. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
