The common goal is to let more and more children receive a high-quality education, even in developing countries. While achieving this goal, there is a specific group of people that we can not ignore – children with functional difficulties. Compared with healthy children, children with functional difficulties have more difficulties and disadvantages in the process of survival and development due to their physical and mental characteristics and lack of social support. Therefore, they are a vulnerable group that needs special care, special support, and special protection. Like all other children, children with functional difficulties share the right to life development and education. The level of education and rehabilitation of children with functional difficulties also reflects social civilization and progress. Accordingly, we must pay great attention to the education attainment worldwide for children with functional difficulties. We find a data set from UNICEF, focusing on the education of the least developed and developing countries for children with and without functional difficulties. We hope to express a clear picture of the educational attainment worldwide for children with and without functional difficulties to our readers. So that we can explore more about what we can do to help children with functional difficulties together. Since the data is labeled with development levels and divided into male, female, urban, and rural, we are going to compare the influences of development levels, genders, and regions on Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR) and Out-of-school children rate(OOSR) for all primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary education levels, the Completion Rate for primary level, and the Functional Learning Skills(reading and numeracy). "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit approved 17 sustainable development goals (SDG). Proper and quality education for every child in this world is always one of the goals. However, children of least-developed countries and some developing countries are not guaranteed equal education. Let alone children with functional difficulties. Children with functional difficulties could experience various limitations, such as communication, self-care, and mobility difficulties. Creating an appropriate learning environment and suitable teaching strategies for children with disabilities is challenging, leading to a lower percentage of education for children with disabilities. Even worse, the pandemic during the last three years has severely influenced the world, including education. Nearly half of the in-person instruction was closed during the pandemic. Remote learning has become the only solution for all students across the globe. However, not every region and child has proper equipment and stable internet access. The data set from UNICEF focuses on the education of the least developed and developing countries for children with and without functional difficulties, aiming to understand the percentage of education completeness in different countries, education levels, and genders. The latest update was in December 2021. Although not every country’s data is updated, we still hope to find the influence of the pandemic. Citation: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals The 4\\(^{\\text{th}}\\) Goal (Quality Education) 2.2 Data availability We are interested in children’s education, and UNICEF was the first site we visited for data. There is one dataset provided on the site for children with disabilities. The completeness and availability are the top two reasons why we considered it to be suitable for our topic. UNICEF maintains the dataset. The UNICEF Global databases contain a set of 202 countries as reported on through the State of the World’s Children Statistical Annex 2017. And the format of data collected is excel. By the cover page of the dataset, the data was collected from the 6th round of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6). The dataset provides information on four education indicators (Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR), Out of school rate (OOR), Completion rate, and foundational learning skills) supporting national education monitoring for children with and without disabilities in 32 countries and areas. The dataset takes levels of education into account for two indicators: Adjusted net attendance rate (ANAR) and Out of school rate (OOR). The Completion rate is recorded on the primary level only. Foundational learning skills consist of foundational reading and numeracy skills, recorded for children aged 7 to 14. The data is only available in Excel. There are ten sheets in the spreadsheet: nine data sheets and one cover page. The cover sheet provides a brief introduction and explanation of the data and variables. Three sheets are available for the Adjusted net attendance rate and the Out of school rate for three levels of education (primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary). The remaining three sheets are for Completion rate, foundational reading skill, and foundational numeracy skill. If any questions arise from the data, we can contact UNICEF Data. Since the data is available in Excel, we can directly load the “readxl” package in R and use the “read_excel” function to import the data. After importing the data, we will process the missing values and try to minimize the influence of time inconsistency. There are three potential issues relating to data quality. The data for different countries and areas are estimated values by point estimating, so there is a gap between the estimated value and real value. Also, the sample sizes for those countries and areas are unknown. The years in which the data collection took place differ for different countries and areas. Though not by a large percentage, there are some missing values.
